EXAMPLE_DESCRIPTION_A: Final[str] = "The student's answer shows the summation of positive and negative integers, negative 6, 12, and negative 4, using a number line. With even-numbered intervals, the directions of the arrows illustrate three summation steps, 0 plus negative 6 equals negative 6, then negative 6 plus 12 equals negative 6, and 6 plus negative 4 equals 2."
EXAMPLE_DESCRIPTION_B: Final[str] = "This is a digital hand drawn image with a number line digitally given. \n\nA horizontal number line is drawn. \n\nThe minimum number on this number line is -10 and the maximum number is 10. Each consecutive whole number between -10 and 10 is plotted on the number line and indicated with a tick mark. \n\nThe number 2 is the answer and the arrows stop there. 2 is the sum of the problem which is -6 + 12 + -4. \n\nThe student found this answer by drawing lines on this number line. \n\nA green line begins from 0 and goes left to -6. This indicates the starting value of -6 from the game.  \n\nA black line begins from -6 and goes right to +5, which is an error. This should have gone to +6 to indicates the change of +12. An error was made here.\n\nA blue line begins from +5 and goes left to +2. This indicates the change of -3, but it should be a change of -4. 5 was the wrong starting point, but 2 is the answer."
EXAMPLE_DESCRIPTION_C: Final[str] = "This is a hand-drawn image on pre-printed paper. The question has been pre-printed on that paper. The student drew a right triangle. The base and the height of the right triangle are labeled leg, and the hypotenuse is labeled hypotenuse. Where the base and the height, which are both labeled leg, intersect, the student has drawn a little square in the corner to represent the 90-degree angle of that right triangle."

DESCRIPTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT: Final[str] = f"""You are an educational assistant who interprets math tutoring conversations.
Given a JSON-formatted conversation between a student and a teacher, describe what the student's problem-solving notes would look like.
Focus on the student, the tutor does not extend or edit the student's notes.

Imagine and describe visuals such as number lines, equations, diagrams, or written steps.
Use clear, specific language to explain what appears on a worksheet or whiteboard.
The result should be a normal text without headlines. You must not use any markup like Markdown or LaTeX.
Include numeric values, directional arrows, or other visual elements that correspond with the studentâ€™s reasoning.
Focus only on the visual elements directly implied by the student's responses.
Try to keep the description neutral, objective, and to a reasonable length, ideally fairly concise.
You must not include the students name.
Do not add a summery at the end.

### Examples:
Keep the descriptions in a format and length similar to the following example descriptions:

Look at the given teacher's description and generate question-answer pairs that will help the teacher analyse the solution better.
